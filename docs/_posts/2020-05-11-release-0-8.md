# Announcing Pomerium 0.8

We are excited to announce the [0.8 release] of Pomerium which adds support for some of our most requested features including:

- [**Automatic Certificate Management**] -- Pomerium now automatically retrieves, renews, and manages free [Let's Encrypt] certificates supported by all major browsers. Pomerium will dynamically retrieve certificates to ensure that all Pomerium managed routes will have a shiny-green HTTPS icon without needing an external certificate management system. In addition, Pomerium will do [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) for automatically managed, and manually managed certificates alike.
- [**Advanced Route Matching**] -- Pomerium now enables operators to write policy that supports matching routes based on [regex], [prefix], and [path] settings. Operators now have the flexibility to have multiple, and layered authorization policies across a single Pomerium managed route. .
- [Github] -- identity provider support.

This release includes 95 commits from 8 authors across 4 organizations and includes additional new features, general improvements, and bug fixes! A complete list of the changes in this release can be found in Pomerium's 0.8 release's [changelog].

As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the Pomerium GitHub [issue tracker].
