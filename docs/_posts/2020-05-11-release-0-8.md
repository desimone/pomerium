# Announcing Pomerium 0.8

We are excited to announce the [0.8 release] of Pomerium which adds support for some of our most requested features including:

- [**Automatic Certificate Management**] -- Pomerium can now automatically retrieve and renew certificates to add dynamic HTTPS to all Pomerium managed routes. In addition, Pomerium will do [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) for automatic, and custom certificates alike.
- [**Advanced Route Matching**] -- Operators can now write access policy that supports route matching based on [regex], [prefix], and [path] settings. Pomerium now has the flexibility to support multiple, and layered authorization policies across a single Pomerium managed route.
- And finally, this release adds identity provider support for [Github].

This release includes 95 commits from 8 authors across 4 organizations and includes additional new features, general improvements, and bug fixes! A complete list of the changes in this release can be found in Pomerium's 0.8 release's [changelog].

As always, we recommend upgrading and testing this release in an isolated environment. If you experience any issues, please report them on the Pomerium GitHub [issue tracker].
