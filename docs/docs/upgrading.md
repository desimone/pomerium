# Overview

## Since 0.0.4

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes for pomerium `v0.0.4` compared to `v0.0.5`. Please read it carefully.

### Breaking: POLICY_FILE removed

Usage of the POLICY_FILE envvar is no longer supported.  Support for file based policy configuratin has been shifted into the new unified config file.  

### Important: Configuration file support added

* Pomerium now supports an optional -config flag.  This flag specifies a file from which to read all configuration options.  It supports yaml, json, toml and properties formats.

* All options which can be specified via MY_SETTING style envvars can now be specified within your configuration file as key/value.  The key is generally the same as the envvar name, but lower cased.  See Reference Documentation for exact names.

* Options precedence is ENV > Config > Defaults

* The options file supports a policy key, which contains policy in the same format as POLICY_FILE.  To convert an existing policy.yaml into a config.yaml, just move your policy under a policy key.

  Old:
  ```yaml
  - from: httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com
    to: http://httpbin
    allowed_domains:
      - pomerium.io
    cors_allow_preflight: true
    timeout: 30s
  ```

  New:
  ```yaml
  policy:
    - from: httpbin.corp.beyondperimeter.com
      to: http://httpbin
      allowed_domains:
        - pomerium.io
      cors_allow_preflight: true
      timeout: 30s
  ```

### Authenticate Internal Service Address

The configuration variable [Authenticate Internal Service URL](https://www.pomerium.io/reference/#authenticate-internal-service-url) must now be a valid [URL](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL) type and contain both a hostname and valid `https` schema.
